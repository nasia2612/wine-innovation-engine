The idea is that as ethanol accumulates in the medium, it becomes more toxic to the yeast cells, leading to an increased death rate. This modification can help capture the dynamics of yeast population decline in high-ethanol environments, which is relevant for wine fermentation where ethanol levels can become inhibitory.
